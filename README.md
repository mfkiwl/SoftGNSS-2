# SoftGNSS for My Studies

**UNOFFICIAL! READ BEFORE FORK/CLONE!**

I am studying GNSS topics for my thesis. To get used to the overall GNSS basically, I am studying on it, sometimes making changes on the files.

When I feel completely ready on it with perfect sample data. I will make a basic guide for the usage of anyone.

**The sample signal I use:** GPSdata-DiscreteComponents-fs38_192-if9_55.bin (I will upload it ASAP)
